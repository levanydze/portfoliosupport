I use to visit my country every year, where my friends and family are waiting for me. Normally, we expect lots of powder snow there, so I can float on the snow just like in clouds, but not that year. All mountains of Europe were dry, and there was no snow as usual. So, frozen slopes and the lack of powder were some of the biggest reasons for my injury."

I also want to mention that using Next.js docs became clearer and easier to follow, and with Framer Motion, I created some cool stuff quickly. In terms of SEO, I've implemented dynamic and static titles in the project. I'm mapping a JSON file onto the /MENU, so when you click each item, you get a (metadata) title based on the food name. So far, this project isn't a specific webpage but more like my own reusable library with different headers, navigations, and more. I'll decide how it should look later on."
